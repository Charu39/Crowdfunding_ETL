# # Crowdfunding_ETL
For the ETL mini project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After transforming  the data, we created four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
